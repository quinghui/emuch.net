The Python script for log the [emuch.net][emuch] in, and pick Emuch Credits up once a day.   
The script can be executed only in Python3, which is Python 3.4 in my case, and it depends the [emuch.net][emuch] cookies to sign in Emuch. 
Therefore, you may need to put your Emuch cookies *_discuz_uid* and *_discuz_pw* value in the beginning of the script.
