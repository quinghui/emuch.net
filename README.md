The Python script for log the [emuch.net][emuch] in, and pick Emuch Credits up once a day.  

The script can be executed only in Python3, which is Python 3.4 in my case, and it depends the [emuch.net][emuch] cookies to sign in Emuch. 
Therefore, you may need to put your Emuch cookies **'_discuz_uid'** and **'_discuz_pw'** value in the beginning of the script.   

The detials in the script are following:
>
   **EMUCH_UID_VALUE = '[_discuz_uid]'**, the value of the cookie **'_discuz_uid'**      
   **EMUCH_PW_VALUE = '[_discuz_pw]'**, the value of the cookie **'_discuz_pw'**
